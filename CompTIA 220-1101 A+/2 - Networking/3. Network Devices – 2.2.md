- **Routers**: Forward traffic between different IP subnets at layer 3, often connecting different types of networks.
- **Switches**: Forward traffic based on destination MAC address at layer 2, commonly used for local network connectivity.
- **Hubs**: Less efficient than switches, they broadcast data to all connected devices, often limited to 10/100 Mbps speeds.
- **Access Points**: Bridge wired and wireless networks, forwarding traffic based on destination MAC address.
- **Firewalls**: Control traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers, some can also act as routers or proxies.
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Provides power and data over the same Ethernet cable, useful for devices like cameras.
- **Cable Modems**: Connect to cable television infrastructure for broadband data, using DOCSIS standards.
- **DSL Modems**: Use telephone lines for broadband internet, offering asymmetric speeds.
- **Fiber Connections**: Use ONT (Optical Network Terminal) to convert fiber signals to Ethernet for home use.
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Provide network connectivity to devices, with different types for various network types.
Each of these devices plays a specific role in network communication, connecting devices and networks together efficiently and securely.
