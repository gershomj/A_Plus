Internet connectivity can be achieved through various methods, each with its own characteristics and considerations:

1. **Satellite Networking**: Uses a satellite dish to communicate with a satellite in low Earth orbit. It provides connectivity where terrestrial options are unavailable, but it can be expensive and have latency issues.

2. **Fiber Optic**: Offers high-speed internet connections over long distances. It's commonly used in enterprise networks and provides high bandwidth, but it's more expensive than other options.

3. **Cable Broadband**: Utilizes the same cable used for cable television to bring internet into homes or businesses. It supports high speeds and allows for multiple types of data transmission over a single wire.

4. **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Uses existing telephone lines to provide high-speed internet. It offers asymmetric speeds, with faster download speeds than upload speeds, and performance can vary based on proximity to the Central Office.

5. **Cellular Networks**: Provides internet connectivity using mobile networks. It's commonly used for mobile devices and can be accessed through tethering or by using the phone as a hotspot.

6. **Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISP)**: Offers internet access through local ground stations instead of satellites. It's often used in rural areas and can provide high speeds using technologies like meshed 802.11 or 5G.

Each type of connection has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on factors such as availability, speed requirements, and cost.
