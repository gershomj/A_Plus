The connectivity options for phones and tablets include both wired and wireless options, providing flexibility for various use cases and environments.

1. **Wired Connectivity**:
    - **USB**: Universal Serial Bus is commonly used for high-speed communication and charging. Older devices may use mini or micro USB, while newer devices use USB-C. Apple devices use Lightning connectors, offering faster charging and reversible insertion.
    - **Serial Communication**: Before USB, devices commonly used DB-9 (DE-9) serial connections, such as for modems and mice. RS232 signals were often transported over these connections.

2. **Wireless Connectivity**:
    - **NFC**: Near Field Communication allows for data transfer between devices in close proximity. It's used for payments, data transfers, and access devices.
    - **Bluetooth**: Popular for wireless earbuds, headsets, and connecting to car audio systems.
    - **Wi-Fi Hotspot**: Many phones can act as wireless hotspots, allowing other devices to connect to the internet through the phone's wireless provider network.
