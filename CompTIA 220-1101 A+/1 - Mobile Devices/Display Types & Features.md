Here's the table in a code block:

```
| Type                | Features                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TN (Twisted Nematic)| - Fast response times, suitable for gaming<br>- Poor viewing angles and color accuracy                                                                                                |
| IPS (In-Plane Switching) | - Excellent color representation and wide viewing angles<br>- Suitable for graphics and desktop publishing<br>- More expensive than TN |
| VA (Vertical Alignment) | - Good color representation<br>- Slower response times than TN<br>- Middle ground between TN and IPS                                                                                    |
