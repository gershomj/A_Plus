 Study notes for the A+ CompTIA Exam

All notes, summaries, tables, and graphics presented here are my personal study notes based on content from Professor Messer's website (https://www.professormesser.com) and YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser). I want to make it clear that these notes are not a replacement for Professor Messer's content. I do not claim credit for the content summarized here, as it is all derived from Professor Messer's website and YouTube videos. I also want to acknowledge that I had assistance in compiling these study notes using AI.
