**Local Area Network (LAN):**
- Encompasses devices within a building or nearby buildings
- Offers high bandwidth connectivity through Ethernet or 802.11 wireless networks

**Wide Area Network (WAN):**
- Connects devices across long distances
- Speeds are often slower than LANs
- Uses technologies like point-to-point connections, MPLS, or satellite links

**Personal Area Network (PAN):**
- Connects devices like wireless earbuds to phones
- Uses technologies like Bluetooth, NFC, or infrared
- Common in vehicles to integrate phones with audio systems

**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):**
- Connects multiple sites within a city
- Offers longer-distance connectivity than LANs but shorter than WANs
- Often uses metro ethernet

**Storage Area Network (SAN):**
- Provides high-speed access to centralized storage
- Allows efficient reading and writing of large files
- Often isolated on their own high-speed networks

**Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):**
- Connects devices wirelessly within a building
- Uses 802.11 technology
- Additional access points are used to extend coverage beyond the immediate area
