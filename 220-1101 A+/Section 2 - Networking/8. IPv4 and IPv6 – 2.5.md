IP version 4 (IPv4) is the primary protocol for internet communication. It uses 32-bit addresses, such as 192.168.1.131. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit addresses, like FE80::5D18:652:CFFD:8F52, and was created to address the issue of IPv4 address exhaustion.

IPv6 addresses are often assigned with a 64-bit subnet mask, which separates the network and host addresses. When configuring a device's IP settings, you need to assign an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. The default gateway is the IP address of a router that allows the device to communicate outside its local subnet.

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names (e.g., www.google.com) to IP addresses. It is configured in the device's network settings. DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are commonly used for redundancy.
