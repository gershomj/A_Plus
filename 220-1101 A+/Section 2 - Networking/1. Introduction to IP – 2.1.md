Data is broken into packets for transmission over networks, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery.
- Each packet includes a header containing information such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocol type (TCP or UDP), and port numbers.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
    - TCP establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer, ensuring both parties are ready to exchange data.
    - It uses sequence numbers to organize and reassemble packets in the correct order at the receiving end.
    - TCP also includes mechanisms for flow control and error recovery, ensuring data is delivered accurately and efficiently.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that offers faster, but less reliable, delivery compared to TCP.
    - UDP does not establish a connection before sending data, making it faster but potentially less secure.
    - It does not guarantee packet delivery or order, making it suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability, such as real-time communication or video streaming.
- IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network, allowing packets to be routed to the correct destination.
- Port numbers identify specific services or applications on a device, enabling multiple services to run on the same device without conflict.
    - Well-known port numbers (0-1023) are reserved for common services like HTTP (port 80) and SMTP (port 25).
    - Ephemeral port numbers (1024-65535) are dynamically assigned by the operating system to client applications for temporary use.
- Together, TCP, UDP, IP addresses, and port numbers form the foundation of modern networking, enabling efficient and reliable communication across the internet.
