Wireless networks have become ubiquitous, with standards set by the IEEE 802 LAN MAN committee, specifically the 802.11 standard, commonly known as Wi-Fi. The evolution of Wi-Fi includes:

1. **802.11a**: Released in 1999, operates at 5 GHz, and offers a speed of 54 Mbps. It's less common today due to limited range at higher frequencies.

2. **802.11b**: Also from 1999, operates at 2.4 GHz with a speed of 11 Mbps, providing better range but slower speeds than 802.11a.

3. **802.11g**: Released in 2003, operates at 2.4 GHz with a speed of 54 Mbps, offering an upgrade path from 802.11b with backward compatibility.

4. **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**: Introduced in 2009, operates in both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz, with up to 600 Mbps throughput and MIMO support for faster and more efficient data transfer.

5. **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**: Released in 2014, operates exclusively in 5 GHz, offering higher throughput (up to 6.9 Gbps) and improved channel utilization with wider channel widths.

6. **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: Introduced in 2021, operates in both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz, supporting up to 9.6 Gbps throughput with improved efficiency in high-density environments using OFDMA.

Wireless networks can be extended using directional antennas for longer distances or fixed wireless connections, but local regulations and safety considerations must be followed. RFID and NFC technologies are also used for various applications, including access control, inventory management, and contactless payments, expanding the utility of wireless technologies in daily life.
