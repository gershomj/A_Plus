**Cable Tools:**
- Cable crimpers are used to add connectors to the ends of cables, such as RJ45 connectors for Ethernet cables.
- Electrician scissors or cable snips can be used to cut cables to length.
- A wire stripper is used to remove the insulation from wires before crimping.

**Testing and Troubleshooting Tools:**
- A cable tester checks for continuity and proper pin connections in cables.
- Loopback plugs or cables can test the functionality of interfaces by looping data back into the same device.
- Network taps, both physical and virtual (SPAN), can be used to monitor network traffic for troubleshooting or analysis purposes.

**Wireless Networking:**
- A Wi-Fi analyzer can be used to understand the frequencies in use on a wireless network and identify interference.
- Bluetooth, infrared, and NFC are common technologies used in Personal Area Networks (PANs), such as connecting wireless earbuds or integrating mobile phones with car audio systems.

**Advanced Networking Concepts:**
- Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) connect multiple sites within the same city or geographic area using technologies like metro ethernet.
- Storage Area Networks (SANs) provide centralized storage facilities accessed over a high-speed network.
- Time Domain Reflectometers (TDRs) are used for advanced measurements like crosstalk values and signal loss in cables.
