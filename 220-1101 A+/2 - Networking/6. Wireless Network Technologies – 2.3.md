When using an 802.11 network, understanding technical specifications is crucial. This includes the frequency range used, such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, and the channels within these ranges. Different countries have regulations governing wireless spectrum usage, dictating frequencies, power limits, and interference restrictions.

Comparing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, 5 GHz offers more channels and bandwidth options, making it less congested and more suitable for high-density environments. For example, 2.4 GHz only has three non-overlapping channels (1, 6, and 11), while 5 GHz provides numerous available channels for communication.

Bluetooth also operates in the 2.4 GHz band, specifically the unlicensed ISM band, allowing for wireless connectivity between devices within a limited range (usually around 10 meters). Industrial Bluetooth standards can extend this range to over 100 meters, but for consumer devices, the range is typically limited to 10 meters.
