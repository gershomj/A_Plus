Cloud computing has transformed networking by virtualizing physical infrastructure devices into software-based platforms. Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables this shift by separating networking components into three layers:

1. **Infrastructure Layer (Data Plane)**: Handles forwarding, trunking, encrypting, and other packet-level functions.
2. **Control Layer (Control Plane)**: Manages references for traffic forwarding, dynamic routing protocols, and device configuration.
3. **Application Layer (Management Plane)**: Provides access to manage the device via SSH, graphical interfaces, or APIs.

SDN allows for the creation of software versions of physical devices like switches, routers, and firewalls. These virtual devices mimic the functions of their physical counterparts in the cloud environment, creating a modular and scalable networking architecture.
