Advancements in mobile network technologies have revolutionized the way people communicate and access information, providing faster speeds, greater reliability, and enhanced capabilities for a wide range of devices and applications.

1. **Cellular Networks**:
    - Cellular networks divide geographical areas into smaller sections called cells, each served by a base station or antenna.
    - The term "cellular" refers to the use of these cells to provide coverage over a large area.
    - Original cellular networks included 2G technologies such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).
    - GSM was predominant globally, with about 90% market share, and used SIM cards for user identification and authentication.
    - CDMA used a different approach, where each call was assigned a unique code to allow multiple calls to share the same frequency without interference.

2. **3G Technology**:
    - Introduced in 1998, 3G technologies provided faster data speeds and more capabilities than 2G networks.
    - It enabled features like GPS, mobile television, streaming video, and improved data rates for mobile devices.

3. **LTE (Long Term Evolution)**:
    - LTE, introduced as 4G technology, was a converged standard that combined elements of GSM and CDMA.
    - It significantly increased data throughput, up to 150 Mbps initially, and later up to 300 Mbps with LTE Advanced (LTE-A).
    - LTE provided a more efficient use of the radio spectrum and improved latency compared to previous technologies.

4. **5G Technology**:
    - 5G is the fifth generation of cellular networking, introduced in 2020, offering greatly enhanced speeds and lower latency.
    - It is expected to provide speeds up to 10 Gbps, although initial deployments may offer speeds between 100 and 900 Mbps.
    - 5G enables new use cases and applications, including IoT devices, augmented reality, and virtual reality.

5. **Updates and Features**:
    - Mobile devices receive updates, including Preferred Roaming List (PRL) updates, which help the device connect to the appropriate towers for roaming.
    - Devices can act as Wi-Fi hotspots, allowing other devices to connect to the internet through the cellular network.
    - Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities may be limited or require additional charges from the cellular provider.
